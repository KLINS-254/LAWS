          21. Desire follows confidence, never desperation.<br>
          22. Presence outweighs performance; attention is authority.<br>

          36. Shape the environment, and the environment shapes behavior.<br>
          37. Leave space for longing; oversaturation kills it.<br>
          38. Composure is irresistible; frenzy repels.<br>
          39. Confidence must remain steady, unshaken by doubt.<br>
          40. End with impact; leave desire unresolved, not exhausted.
